Hi I am ThienViet.
This is my first post in Git Hub.
I am really nervous so I try to explain so fast as I can.

This is a password generator which I build for everyone.

First of all, you can choose these two options.
Options:    pin    password

Please, avoid Password, passworD, paSSword, etc.

If you choose pin, then it will show "Your pin is: {random numbers}".
The length of the numbers is automaticly four.

But if you choose password,
you have the option to choose the length of the password.
After that it will show "Your password is: {random uppercase, lowercase, digits and punctaution} "

This is the end of my explanation.

I wish you a happy day. :)
Bye.

If you have some questions, there might be an answer for you. If not, you can ask me everytime you want. I will answer, if I have time for it.


Q: Why do you write "import string"? I don't get it.

A: Because I heard from someone that there is every numbers, special characters, and letters. I am lazy, you know? And if I make one little mistake, I will regret it for decades.


Q: Are you the one in the Discord channel?

A: Erm...yeah, I think. There are also users with a random nickname and random numbers behind the #. It might be me, but it might be not me, too.


Q: How are you today?

A: Thank you for the question. I am happy to help someone. That is all. :D


Q: Which python version does it work?

A: I think 3.9


Q: Why do you don't use liceses?

A: I am not good in english. There are so much unknown words. That is all.
